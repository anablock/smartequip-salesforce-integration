## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("config.py", "Contains configuration variables such as API URLs and access tokens."),
    ("salesforce_api.py", "Implements SalesforceAPI class with methods to get and update orders."),
    ("smarthequip_api.py", "Implements SmartEquipAPI class with methods to get and process orders."),
    ("integration.py", "Implements Integration class that uses SalesforceAPI and SmartEquipAPI to sync orders."),
    ("web_interface.py", "Implements a Flask web interface for monitoring and controlling the integration."),
    ("main.py", "Initializes SalesforceAPI, SmartEquipAPI, and Integration, and starts the Flask web interface.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "config.py",
    "salesforce_api.py",
    "smarthequip_api.py",
    "integration.py",
    "web_interface.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'config.py' contains configuration variables such as API URLs and access tokens. These should be set according to the actual environments of Salesforce and SmartEquip.

'salesforce_api.py' and 'smarthequip_api.py' use the 'requests' library to interact with the APIs of Salesforce and SmartEquip, respectively. They should handle any potential errors or inconsistencies in data.

'integration.py' uses the SalesforceAPI and SmartEquipAPI to sync orders. It should ensure seamless data transfer between the two systems.

'web_interface.py' uses the 'flask' library to create a user-friendly web interface for the integration. The web interface should allow users to monitor the status of the integration and perform basic operations.

'main.py' is the entry point of the program. It initializes SalesforceAPI, SmartEquipAPI, and Integration, and starts the Flask web interface.

## Anything UNCLEAR
The specific API endpoints and data formats for Salesforce and SmartEquip are not provided in the requirement. We will need to consult the API documentation of both systems during the actual implementation.
