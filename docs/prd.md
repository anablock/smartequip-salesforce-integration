## Original Requirements
Our boss has tasked us with designing an integration between Salesforce and SmartEquip. The goal of this integration is to process orders in SmartEquip and then push these orders to Salesforce CPQ.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a seamless integration between Salesforce and SmartEquip",
    "Ensure efficient order processing in SmartEquip",
    "Successfully push processed orders from SmartEquip to Salesforce CPQ"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a sales representative, I want to process orders in SmartEquip and have them automatically updated in Salesforce CPQ",
    "As a manager, I want to view the status of orders processed in SmartEquip from Salesforce CPQ",
    "As a customer service representative, I want to be able to track customer orders from Salesforce CPQ that were processed in SmartEquip",
    "As a business analyst, I want to generate reports on order processing from Salesforce CPQ that includes data from SmartEquip",
    "As a system administrator, I want to ensure the integration between Salesforce and SmartEquip is functioning properly"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Zapier: Offers a wide range of integrations, including Salesforce and SmartEquip, but may not offer the specific functionality required for order processing and pushing to Salesforce CPQ",
    "MuleSoft: Provides robust integration services, but may be overly complex for this specific use case",
    "Workato: Offers Salesforce and SmartEquip integration, but may not focus on order processing specifically",
    "Jitterbit: Offers a Salesforce integration platform, but SmartEquip integration may not be as seamless",
    "Dell Boomi: Provides a platform for building integrations, but may require more technical expertise",
    "IBM App Connect: Offers a wide range of integrations, but may not have specific functionality for Salesforce and SmartEquip order processing",
    "Informatica: Provides robust data integration capabilities, but may be overly complex for this specific use case"
]
```

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Create a seamless integration between Salesforce and SmartEquip", "P0"),
    ("Ensure efficient order processing in SmartEquip", "P0"),
    ("Successfully push processed orders from SmartEquip to Salesforce CPQ", "P0"),
    ("Provide a user-friendly interface for the integration", "P1"),
    ("Ensure the integration requires minimal technical expertise to operate", "P2")

## UI Design draft
The user interface should be clean and intuitive, with clear labels for all functions. It should include a dashboard that displays the status of order processing in SmartEquip and the status of order pushing to Salesforce CPQ. The layout should be organized in a way that allows users to easily navigate between different functions.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.
